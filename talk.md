## That was a
## lot of work...

## How did I do it?

---
# Lots of
# Planning

---
### Week 4
## Tetris in VR

---
// good week-long project
// skills we've picked up over cardboctober
// 2-dimensional array manipulation
// collision algorithms

---
## What have
## I learned?

---
// stuff
// save time by factoring out common boilerplate to save time
// test often, test on other people
// you're not creating AAA games every day, so don't worry about making it perfect
// if you're learning from it, others can too

---
## Pros

---
### Force yourself to learn something new

---
### Great for content creation

---
### Github commit streak

---
## Cons

---
### Takes a lot of time

^ 2-3 hours per day

---
### Be considerate of
### your loved ones

^ My wife had to listen to me talk about VR non-stop for a month
